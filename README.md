 ## 1. Project Overview
This was a pair coding project, where we were briefed to **build a React application** that consumes a **public API**. My coding partner and I both had to decide on a common theme for the project. We both made a list of interests we had and from that we both had a common interest in Yu-Gi-Oh and decided to use the Yu-Gi-Oh API to build a website.
