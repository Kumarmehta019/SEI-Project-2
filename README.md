 ## 1. Project Overview
Project two was an opportunity to work as a pair to **build a React application** that consumes a **public API**. My patner and I both had to decide on a common theme for the propject using the public API options we had. We both made a list of interests we had and from that we both had a common interest in Yu-Gi-Oh and decided to use the Yu-Gi-Oh API to build a card trading website.
