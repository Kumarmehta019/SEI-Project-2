 ## 1. Project Overview
This was a pair coding project, where we were briefed to **build a React application** that consumes a **public API**. My coding partner and I both had to decide on a common theme for the project. We both made a list of interests we had and from that we both had a common interest in Yu-Gi-Oh and decided to use the Yu-Gi-Oh API to build a website.

## 4. Project Timeline- 2 Days

### Planning:
The first day was spent finding a common interest between my coding partner and I. It was then a matter of reviewing and breaking down the dataset/type we would receive from the API. The data was tested in Insomnia to make sure the requests were working correctly. We looked into different endpoints to see which one we would need and how we could manipulate them to display on the frontend.
